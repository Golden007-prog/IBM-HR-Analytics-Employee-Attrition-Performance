## 🌟 Flask Web App for HR Dashboard
I developed a **Flask-based web app** that:
- Converts uploaded CSV files into dynamic **Excel dashboards**.
- Highlights key HR metrics like attrition risk, job satisfaction, and overtime patterns.
- Provides **automated recommendations** for HR decisions.

### 🔹 Web App Snapshots
